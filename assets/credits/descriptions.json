  "film1": "*Once Upon a Puppet* was all about building a smooth, headache free animation pipeline from rigging to Unity. I rigged 10 unique characters and made over 20 mix-and-match NPC outfits. The goal? Let animators do their thing and have it all work in-game.\n\nWhat I handled:\n* Led the animation crew and kept things clean and consistent\n* Worked with designers to make sure every move felt right\n* Built and tuned the animation pipeline so it held up under pressure",
  "film2": "For *SnowQueen*, I teamed up with the Animation Lead and followed their vision to animate 10 to 15 seconds per week. It was all about making each moment count. Blinks, breaths, eyebrows — all intentional.",
  "film3": "*Tom and Friends* was fast paced. I worked with the Animation Lead to deliver 15 to 25 seconds weekly. Creative treadmill vibes with strong feedback and the occasional bug driven panic moment.",
  "film4": "*Salma’s Big Wish* was close to my heart. My first feature where I led a small team of four animators. I made sure the work looked great and matched the director’s vision while keeping the team chill and focused."
